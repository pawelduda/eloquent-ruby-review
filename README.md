## Chapter 1
A good wrap-up for the general coding style, even though I already knew most of it. "Good code is like a good joke, it needs no explanations." :)

## Chapter 2
I knew most of it, except for the fact that I keep on forgetting about the ||= operator.

## Chapter 3
It's nice to know about *XmlSimple* gem. Also a nice reminder about Ruby's Set class
